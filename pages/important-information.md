# Important Information for Speakers

## Preparation

- While you may feel free to change your topic at any time, we recommend
  leaving enough time to sufficiently prepare for your talk. Please notify us
  of any topic changes as soon as possible.

- Prepare your abstract at least one week in advance of your talk. **This is
  not a soft deadline.** If your abstract is not ready at least one week in
  advance of your talk, we may cancel your talk.

- If you feel that you will not be able to adequately prepare for your talk in
  time, do not hesitate to contact us. We will try to reschedule your talk.

## Notes

- If you decide to prepare notes for your talk, we would appreciate if you
  could send them to us to use for inclusion on the website.

- Notes must be translated into [Markdown](/write-markdown), but we
  will accept notes in any format and will try our best to convert it to
  Markdown.

## Delivery

- Please come in time for your talk.

- If you are not confident about your talk, please [contact us](/faq)
  and request that we hold a session to go over it.

- Please make the effort to attend as many talks as possible. The seminar is
  about both teaching and learning.

- Please read [Chris Godsil’s comments] on how to deliver a good talk.
