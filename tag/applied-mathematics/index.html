Clifford, building on work by Grassmann and Hamilton. Clifford or geometric algebra shows strong unifying aspects and turned out in the 1960s to be a most adequate formalism for describing different geometry-related algebraic systems as specializations of one 'mother algebra' in various subfields of physics and engineering. Recent work outlines that Clifford algebra provides a universal and powerfull algebraic framework for an elegant and coherent representation of various problems occuring in computer science, signal processing, neural computing, image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision, and robotics. This monograph-like anthology introduces the concepts and framework of Clifford algebra and provides computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and mathematicians with a rich source of examples of how to work with this formalism.</p><p>Quick links: <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=Geometric Computing with Clifford Algebra">Google search</a>, <a href="http://search.arxiv.org:8081/?query=Geometric Computing with Clifford Algebra">arXiv.org search</a>, <a href="/seminar/potential-topics/#request">propose to present a talk</a></p><h3>Gillespie Algorithm</h3><p><a href="/seminar/tag/algorithms" class="tag-link tag-algorithms">algorithms</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/applied-mathematics" class="tag-link tag-applied-mathematics">applied-mathematics</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/computational-mathematics" class="tag-link tag-computational-mathematics">computational-mathematics</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/differential-equations" class="tag-link tag-differential-equations">differential-equations</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/probability" class="tag-link tag-probability">probability</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/stochastic-equations" class="tag-link tag-stochastic-equations">stochastic-equations</a> </p><h4>Possible References</h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/seminarsS05/Karig_slides.pdf">David Karig</a></p></li></ul><p>Quick links: <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=Gillespie Algorithm">Google search</a>, <a href="http://search.arxiv.org:8081/?query=Gillespie Algorithm">arXiv.org search</a>, <a href="/seminar/potential-topics/#request">propose to present a talk</a></p><h3>The Brachistochrone and the Calculus of Variations</h3><p><a href="/seminar/tag/applied-mathematics" class="tag-link tag-applied-mathematics">applied-mathematics</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/calculus-of-variations" class="tag-link tag-calculus-of-variations">calculus-of-variations</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/physics" class="tag-link tag-physics">physics</a> </p><h4>Possible References</h4><ul><li><p><a href="http://www.osaka-ue.ac.jp/zemi/nishiyama/math2010/cycloid.pdf">Yutuka Nishiyama</a></p></li></ul><h4>Related Past Talks</h4><ul><li><a href="/seminar/archive/mj-BCV">Brachistochrone</a></li></ul><p>Johann Bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of Acta Eruditorum in June, 1696. He published his solution in the journal in May of the following year, and noted that the solution is the same curve as Huygens's tautochrone curve. After deriving the differential equation for the curve by the method given above, he went on to show that it does yield a cycloid. Bernoulli allowed six months for the solutions but none were received during this period. At the request of Leibniz, the time was publicly extended for a year and a half. On 29 January 1697 the challenge was received by Isaac Newton, who found it in his mail, in a letter from Johann Bernoulli, when he arrived home from the Royal Mint at 4 p.m., and stayed up all night to solve it and mailed the solution anonymously by the next post. Upon reading the solution, Bernoulli immediately recognized its author, exclaiming that he 'recognizes a lion from his claw marks'. This story gives some idea of Newton's power, since Johann Bernoulli took two weeks to solve it. At the end, five mathematicians responded with solutions: Newton, Jakob Bernoulli (Johann's brother), Gottfried Leibniz, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Guillaume de l'Hôpital. Four of the solutions (excluding l'Hôpital's) were published in the same edition of the journal as Johann Bernoulli's. In his paper Jakob Bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that above before showing that its solution is a cycloid.[8] According to Newtonian scholar Tom Whiteside, In an attempt to outdo his brother, Jakob Bernoulli created a harder version of the brachistochrone problem. In solving it, he developed new methods that were refined by Leonhard Euler into what the latter called (in 1766) the calculus of variations. </p><p>Quick links: <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=The Brachistochrone and the Calculus of Variations">Google search</a>, <a href="http://search.arxiv.org:8081/?query=The Brachistochrone and the Calculus of Variations">arXiv.org search</a>, <a href="/seminar/potential-topics/#request">propose to present a talk</a></p><h3>The Cantor Set and Dynamical systems</h3><p><a href="/seminar/tag/analysis" class="tag-link tag-analysis">analysis</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/applied-mathematics" class="tag-link tag-applied-mathematics">applied-mathematics</a> <a href="/seminar/tag/dynamical-systems" class="tag-link tag-dynamical-systems">dynamical-systems</a> </p><h4>Possible References</h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2589144.pdf">Kraft</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/265925/where-do-cantor-sets-naturally-occur">Math Stackexchange</a></p></li></ul><h4>Related Past Talks</h4><ul><li><a href="/seminar/archive/jb-Cantor">Cantor Set and Dynamical Systems</a></li></ul><p>Quick links: <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=The Cantor Set and Dynamical systems">Google search</a>, <a href="http://search.arxiv.org:8081/?query=The Cantor Set and Dynamical systems">arXiv.org search</a>, <a href="/seminar/potential-topics/#request">propose to present a talk</a></p></article></section></body></html>
